## Instructions for the image:

1) Download the image file
2) If compressed, uncompress the zip file of this site.  The image tar is good as it is.
3) Use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) (or Etcher) to burn the image to an SD card
4) Insert the SD into a Raspberry Pi with the Adafruit hat
5) Power on the Raspberry Pi. You should see the menu show up after the os loads.

PWM pins should be working, but the sensor has a proxy in this image.
